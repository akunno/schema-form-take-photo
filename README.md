# schema-form-take-photo
Cordova integration for Angular Schema Form to allow phones to take photos.

Check out the project, then open the example.html file to show a working demo. 
The "Take Photo" functionality is replaced on browsers by an automatic image. On cordova apps, this will actually work with your device's camera.
